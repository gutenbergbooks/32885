<h2>By Richard E. Stockham</h2>

<h2>Illustrated by Ed Emsh</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT SEEMED they had argued
for years as they were arguing
tonight. The man paced back and
forth chain-smoking cigarettes; the
woman sat motionless, watching
him. They glanced at their watches
with fearful eyes. They heard, with
acutely alert ears, the goings and
comings of people in the hall;
heard the shattering blast of rockets
in the sky above the city. And
they argued.</div>

<p>"So you're going through with
it tonight," he said heavily, "in
your own way."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should stop you." He
crushed out his cigarette. "If the
police were to hear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" The word was thrown at
him. "I know you don't mean that.
But it's unworthy of you even to
say it." She covered her face with
nervous hands. "After all I <i>am</i>
your wife."</p>

<p>He stood over her, his lips tight.
There was something of the fragile,
finely made puppet about her, he
thought, as though she had been
refashioned a hundred times by
some artisan seeking after perfect
delicacy and precision. He softened
momentarily.</p>

<p>"Come with me then," he said.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why? Why?"</p>

<p>"Your way is <i>wrong</i>."</p>

<p>"We're the last two leaders of
the opposition alive." His voice
came swiftly and low. "The authority's
beaten us. Their setup for killing,
imprisonment, bribery and
blackmail functions too well. Our
whole organization's been scattered
like matchsticks. The police are
closing in on us. We're finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
here on earth. We'll be lucky if
we're killed quickly." He waited a
moment for his words to take
effect. "We go along together that
far."</p>

<p>She stood, clasping her hands.
"Of course. Of course."</p>

<p>"Look. I know you've finished
that damned contraption of yours
that'll take you into the atoms. I
know you've been working on it
for years. But I've been working
too. My ship's been ready to take
off into super-space for two days.
But I haven't gone. I've been waiting
for you. To wait at a time like
this is to ask for death or worse.
Now I demand you give up this insane
idea of going into the atoms.
You've got to come with me."</p>

<p>"I've told you I can't escape
with you out into the macrocosm.
It's not my <i>way</i>!"</p>

<p>"The word 'escape' doesn't apply,"
he snapped, "to what I'm doing.
<i>You're</i> escaping. You'll creep
into the microcosm and sit there
like a seed that won't grow. You
can't fight the Authority from the
microcosm. That way is utter passivity
and death. <i>My</i> way is fighting
back. I'm going into hyper-space.
My ship and I'll become so
huge and powerful I'll throw suns
around like snowballs. I'll toss
meteors around like grains of corn.
I'll upset gravities and warp time.
I'll stretch and straighten space.
I'll turn dimensions inside out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. You'll destroy. You'll ruin
everything, you'll break the innocent
as well as the guilty."</p>

<p>"I'll have to take that chance,"
he said grimly. "But I'll destroy the
Authority and everything that goes
with it."</p>

<p>She pulled from his grasp. "Violence
and destruction are not my
way. They never have been."
Slowly now she sank into the chair,
looked past him as she spoke.
"You've always worshipped spaces
and vacuums and voids. I've always
been happy working with
flowers and trees, the life of the
meadow and valley, the rain and
the new, small buds in springtime.
We have always gone in opposite
directions."</p>

<p>She paused and smiled a bit
wistfully. "It's funny. Now we find,
too late to help our marriage, that
there's a whole universe between
us. You refuse, or perhaps you're
afraid, I don't know, to go to the
source of everything&mdash;this table,
this chair, this gown, your own
flesh. You don't want to understand
life; any more than you want
to understand me. You must conquer
it&mdash;or destroy it. You must be
a giant that can kick the earth
around like a football. But I <i>do</i>
want to understand, for in understanding
lies the cure. My machine
will take me into the atoms. I'll become
part of the fabric and tapestry
of the very warp and woof of
our world. By becoming a <i>part</i> of
it, I will <i>know</i>. I'll find the secret
of life in inner space and I'll return
and release our people from the
Authority. And you? You'll never
<i>really</i> understand anything. You'll
be a wild comet, yes, but I'll be a
raindrop in a deep well, learning
patience. I'll be a true healer."</p>

<p>For a moment sadness rose and
softened his face. "There's nothing
more to say, is there."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"We'll make the goodbys quick."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
He came to her. "At least we're being
honest with each other. No lies.
No pettiness. We've developed
pretty powerful ideals. And they
just won't fit together. It's that
simple&mdash;and that good."</p>

<p>She looked up at him and
smiled. "At least I haven't lost you
to another woman."</p>

<p>He returned her smile. "We're
getting sentimental. This isn't
good. It's weakening." He bent
and lightly kissed her hair. For an
instant her breathing stopped.</p>

<p>"Goodby."</p>

<p>"Goodby," she whispered.</p>

<p>He strode to the door and
opened it. His body snapped taut.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class='cap'>CONFRONTING him with a
drawn blaster, stood a man in
the shining red garb of the police
command. He resembled Mephisto
with his flowing cape and snug
trousers. His face was dark, his
nose thin, his eyes black and very
bright.</div>

<p>"You seem surprised," said the
man in red.</p>

<p>Aria had half risen from the
chair. As the eyes of the policeman
turned on her, she sank back.</p>

<p>"How opportune," the policeman
continued. "The eve of your
departures." The smile set on his
mouth. His gun snapped up on a
line with Thorus' heart. "No sudden
moves, or you'll be burnt to a
cinder. But no. That's what you
want&mdash;a quick death. So let me
threaten you with merely burning
your legs off." The blaster lowered.
"It may interest you to know we
have a recording of your whole
conversation. But there's something
else."</p>

<p>His eyes holding Thorus, he
gave a sharp command to two
burly, bullnecked policemen. They
stepped from the shadows and
stood behind the commander. One
held a small, black box.</p>

<p>"I see," the commander said,
"You've had experience before
with the truth clamps. You're
frightened."</p>

<p>Thorus motioned the commander
inside. "A little fear trickles
through my hate."</p>

<p>The door swung shut behind the
three policemen. Thorus glanced at
Aria. Her fingers clutched the
arms of the chair. He knew she
was thinking of the blocks that had
recently been installed in their
minds by X-ray hypnosis. Would
the blocks hold after three days?
Three days, they both knew was
the limit.</p>

<p>"It's your methods of escape we
must have," said the commander.
He motioned to one of the policemen.</p>

<p>Thorus watched the man step in
front of him and raise the clamps
to his forehead. He saw features
that were thick and heavy, as
though they had been roughly
moulded out of too wet clay.</p>

<p>"You can see," the commander
went on, "the tremendous advantage
to us of being able to go into
the macrocosm and toss meteors
around like bits of corn, as you
say." He glanced at Aria, who sat
huddled in the chair, like a porcelain
doll. "And then into the microcosm.
Unlimited power. A
whole new universe to conquer and
colonize."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Aria did not move or speak.</p>

<p>"I see she refuses to face reality."
He turned to Thorus. "But
<i>you</i> will face reality&mdash;and so will
she when we've finished. Had you
conducted your experiments in behalf
of the Authority, you would
have been well rewarded. But no,
you have been working against us&mdash;however,
it has been <i>for</i> the Authority
after all."</p>

<p>Thorus felt the clamps tight on
his temples, like two steel fingers.
Sitting stiffly on a chair, he felt
sweat on his back and chest, felt it
seep from his forehead down into
his eyes, felt the burn of salt. There
was tightness all through him as he
waited for the first shock. His fingernails
cut his palms. His breath
stopped. His shoulders and arms
hardened, stretched tight his tunic.</p>

<p>The commander flicked his
finger at the one kneeling before
the little black box. This one
tripped a lever. A soft hum seemed
to rise from the box and fill the
room.</p>

<p>Thorus listened to the hum grow
until it was a soft, high pitched
scream. He closed his eyes. The
next instant a shattering blow
ripped through every inch of his
body. Fire ran along his nerves. He
felt his lips grimacing away from
his teeth, felt the corners of his
mouth stretching back to his ears.
Oh God, oh God, he cried out in
silent agony. Hold back my
screams. Then he heard himself
groan. He cut off the sound of it.
Choked. Heard a growl deep in his
chest. Lights flashed in his eyes
and there was a tearing apart
through his whole body. A squeezing
together rushed all around him
and an insane pounding and pulling
as though his flesh were being
beaten and clawed from his bones.
Time dropped away from him until
it seemed he had never been
aware of anything but this agony.
Then he was empty of sensation.
He felt himself fall forward, felt
heavy hands catch him roughly
and set him upright. The soft voice
of the commander flowed into his
mind like a voice from outer
space:</p>

<p>"You will tell us your method of
going into the macrocosm. The
equations, the type ship, its propellent,
where the ship is hidden."</p>

<p>Thorus felt enveloped in a void.</p>

<p>The voice of the commander
droned on. "All we need is a clue.
We'll work out the rest."</p>

<p>Life and feeling and thought
were surging back into Thorus
now. Strength filled his muscles
again. Sight came into his eyes.
Again he sat straight and stiff on
the chair. The block held, he
thought. It held and they cannot
know now!</p>

<p>"Speak!" The commander's
voice rose. "Damn you!" He seized
Thorus by the hair. "You've
blocked off the information. I'll see
both of you tortured until you'll
wish to kill each other. Then we'll
try the clamps again." He smashed
his fist into Thorus' face.</p>

<p>On the instant the commander
pulled back his fist, Thorus
reached out and jerked the blaster
from his belt. His foot came up
hard against the man's groin.
There was a grunting cry of pain.
Thorus fell backward off the stool,
pressing the blaster trigger as he
hit the floor. He saw blood gush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
from the commander's middle, saw
him pitch sideways, like a broken
statue, heard Aria's scream. The
clamps pulled from his head. He
swung the gun's muzzle to the two
policemen, clawing at their holsters.
The blaster struck out, a long
coughing hiss, a spray of flame.
There were cries and gasps and
jerking and clutching and the
scrambling fall of the two bodies.</p>

<p>Then silence.</p>

<p>Thorus crawled unsteadily to his
feet, stood swaying. The gun hung
loosely in his hand. Now he felt
Aria close to him, heard her voice
trembling and breathy.</p>

<p>"Thorus! Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The blocks held! They held!"</p>

<p>Steadying himself, he saw Aria
glance at the bodies on the floor.</p>

<p>"Destruction!" she shuddered.
"Nothing but destruction. Oh God,
I'm sick of it!"</p>

<p>Thorus let the gun drop to the
floor. "There's no time to talk.
Your laboratory." He grasped her
by the shoulders and turned her
toward a bright steel door across
the room. "<i>You'll</i> save time to go
into your damned microcosm.
<i>You'll</i> make it. Good luck. If I
have any luck at all, I'll make it
too." He gave her a push. Without
speaking or turning back, she
moved across the room, as though
sleep walking. The gleaming door
slab slid back as she approached it,
closed behind her.</p>

<p>The memory of her face stayed
in his mind for a long moment after
she had disappeared, and from
the room's atmosphere he seemed
to breathe in regret and a sense of
their failure. He turned abruptly,
looked down at each crumpled
body. Opening the door a crack, he
searched the brightly lighted street
for the figure of a policeman, saw
none, stepped outside and ran.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class='cap'>IN HER laboratory, Aria worked
deftly, swiftly at the transparent
body-length cylinder. She checked
wire connections, dials, buttons,
then opened one end of the tube,
lowered herself into place, when
she had closed the tube, she lay
still, the forefinger of her right
hand resting on a button.</div>

<p>During all these preparations,
she was viewing, with her inner
sight, Thorus' tiny ship streaking
through the night toward a distant
mountain peak where a small metal
ball, large enough for one man,
sat shrouded by a screen of invisibility.
Now she saw the streak of
flame die in the night and the tiny
ship sitting motionless beside the
metal ball; saw Thorus open a
hatch in the ball's side, let himself
through the opening and swing
shut the circle of steel.</p>

<p>"Thank God," she said. "Whatever
comes now, at least he's made
it."</p>

<p>Wiping away the vision of him,
she hesitated a moment, said goodby
to earth and life as she'd
known it and would never know it
again. A moment of yearning for
a chance to live safely and well as
a wife and mother swept her with
sadness. The yearning held her finger
from the button; a final hugging
of human love and full human
life, a last lonely cry for earth as
she had known it in childhood
with the press of wind and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
touch and sight of green growing
things and the depth of blue above
and the ground beneath.</p>

<p>Feeling then as though she were
plunging into midnight ocean
depths, she thrust her finger hard
against the button!</p>

<p>Instantly light shimmered all
about!</p>

<p>The room dissolved. A sense of
dreaming too vividly, yet of being
deep in a sleep that was a thousand
times more acutely awake than
any awakeness she had ever known
filled all her being. She felt herself
sinking into a great bottomless
depth and yet at the same time
soaring through space to the ends
of the universe, until both falling
and soaring flowed into each other
and became suspension. And then
suddenly she saw all things as one.
She saw the intricate design of a
snowflake that was the snows of all
the earth and a drop of water that
held all the oceans.</p>

<p>There was the rhythmic beating
all around as though of a great,
omnipresent heart and the surge
and flow of oceans of lifeblood and
the rise and fall of eternal breathing.
A speck of soil was the soil of
all the earth, from which grew forests
and fields of green. She let herself
out into the space of all this
and was merely there, like time is,
where there is the motion and
change of birth and death and
birth again and death again. She
felt a gentle touch on her body
that was the body of all mankind
and knew it for the touch of air, a
single element of all earth's winds
that yet was all the clear winds of
earth.</p>

<p>The next moment a thundrous
roar crashed like a tidal wave. She
felt a gigantic shaking in all the
snow and water, in the oceans and
mountains, in the air and wind, in
the blood and life and beating
heart. A faltering of the rhythm
and flow went, like a cosmic shudder,
through all this life and
through her own being so that she
was conscious of nausea and ache
and a violent flinging about.</p>

<p>She had a sense then of pulling
within herself, like a sea anemone
that has been touched by an enemy.</p>

<p>And in her silent voice, she cried
out, "Thorus!"</p>

<p>In the macrocosm. Thorus destroying!
Destroying! The next instant
her inner sight swung back
to where Thorus' ship, the shining
metal ball, had leapt up off the
mountain of earth; leapt, in the
fraction of a second, through the
blue earth covering into black, outer
space. Her inner sight saw the
metal ball inflating, a cosmic <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'baloon'">balloon</ins>,
flashing like the sun, then
seeming to fill the space between
all the suns!</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class='cap'>THORUS, in his ship, was
conscious of being a colossus
that could step from planet to
planet as though he were using
them for stones to cross a pond of
earth water. Step past the solar system,
he thought, out into the universe.
Now the sun became a tiny
ball of fire, a lightning bug, the
earth a grain of dust. He could
blow out the light of the sun, flick
Earth and the other planets into
nothingness. "I've broken through,"
he thought. "I've done it! I've been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
released." And looking out and
away, he saw universe upon universe
extending past infinity, it
seemed, an ocean without a horizon.</div>

<p>Now, said his thought, I will destroy
all evil and I shall begin with
the evil of earth. As though he
were looking through a microscope,
he focused his sight on the grain of
dust that was earth. His fingers
made delicate adjustments on a
dial, and earth, softly green and
blue, swam clearly into his vision.
He magnified his sight of earth until
he could see all of it like a gigantic
relief map. He saw the fortified
places of the Authority&mdash;great,
spreading, shining, metal domes;
saw them dotting the earth; saw
the lines of vehicles speeding back
and forth between them. He saw
too the hamlets of the people, in
the spaces between the forts of the
Authority, all places of squalor
with row upon row of boxlike
houses, each exactly like the other.
There were not any green lawns or
shade trees, only houses and streets
and people moving about.</p>

<p>Thorus felt his anger rise. He
pressed a button that flung out
fields of gravity. Earth rocked and
heaved, like an animal in convulsions.
Volcanos exploded, shot out
their flaming, poisonous refuse.
Oceans were monsters writhing
and rolling in their troughs, reaching
onto the land, as though to pull
it beneath them. And the land itself
split wide and snapped shut
great, yawning jaws. There was a
wild rushing about among all the
people, a madness, as though frantic
motion would save them. They
looked up off the convulsed earth
with panic stricken eyes, their
voices raised in agony.</p>

<p>Thorus' voice sounded, "The
time for the death of the Authority
has come. I will crush them as
though I were crushing snails." He
reached out from the ship with
rays that seized meteors and flung
them like a schoolboy flinging
stones at bottles, one by one against
the massive, shining domes of the
Authority. The domes cracked and
split and were crushed. The atomic
bombs broke open with flame that
leapt up yellow tongues and grew
mushrooms in the sky, and a burning
death spread all around.</p>

<p>Then Thorus was quiet, watching
all that he had destroyed.</p>

<p>But suddenly, he became aware
of Aria's thought within him, crying
out. "Destroyer! Murderer! In
moments you've set humanity back
a hundred thousand years. You're
worse than the Authority. There'll
never be any peace for you or for
the earth or even the universe after
what you've done. Other Authorities
will come and you'll have
to destroy them and others and
others. Destruction for you forever,
on and on, until you fill the universe
with it...."</p>

<p>In his mind, Thorus saw her
among the falling snowflakes and
the drops of cool water and the
green, growing atoms; saw her in
the transparent tube sink deeper
and deeper into the microcosm,
away and away like a minnow
swimming down into a beautiful
lake on a summer's day. Deeper,
ever deeper, until there was nothing
but the blue, sleepy water.</p>

<p>As Thorus looked upon the earth
again and saw the terrible destruction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
he had wrought, he trembled.
There was the realization in him
that, beneath his consciousness,
had lain the hope that, after he
had wiped clean the earth, Aria's
healing power would remake it.
But now there would be no healing,
and for thousands of years
earth would lie a smoking ruins
with the people crawling about its
shattered surface like bugs.</p>

<p>He turned from all he saw. He
closed his eyes and threw his ship
out into space, threw it away into
the fathomless void. He must escape
from the universe, must flee
from the horror that filled him at
the desolation he had wrought.
Straight out into space, out into
the forever, where earth would
cease to exist, where he and his remorse
would be lost.</p>

<div class='cap'>GLEAMING suns and galaxies
streaked past yet he seemed
within himself to be hanging motionless
in an infinite sea of blackness
while he knew that the speed
of him cracked through the barrier
of time and space; knew that it
was a speed beyond any conceived
by the mind of man. On into forgetfulness,
escape beyond his memory,
faster and farther away than
his mind, so far away that even
earth would disappear in his
thought.</div>

<p>As incredible distances stretched
almost to breaking between himself
and earth, he thought: So this
is the end. For all I've been and
wanted to be, this is it. A nothingness
beyond the universe.</p>

<p>But as the last word went from
his thought, he saw a greenish blue
ball of light rush toward him. He
watched it inflate in the port. It
enveloped the whole ship. The suns
and the galaxies had faded into
nothingness. He was aware of sinking
into eternal depths but at the
same time he felt himself soaring
until sinking and soaring flowed
into each other. After a time, he
saw shimmering white crystals encircling
his ship. And then the encircling
crystals became one snowflake
reflecting light like the moon.</p>

<p>A great wonder filled him and
he stared in overwhelming awe. He
heard his own heartbeat in his
body and outside the ship, holding
the ship in an eternal throbbing;
heard the flowing of his own blood
like a turbulent river; heard his
breathing become the ebb and flow
of wind, like the sound of surf. His
body too became the soil of earth
and its rock and water and he was
deeply conscious of growth all
through him. He was birth and
death and he was both in one and
he was the life of mankind, of animals,
of plants.</p>

<p>As he waited in what seemed to
be eternity, sunlight broke into his
sight and he saw a field of grass
forming around his ship. Blue sky
swam into focus above him. White
cloud patches formed in the blue
as though they had been ordered
there by the word of creation.
Thorus knew then that he was on
earth again, that he had come up
from deep inside it.</p>

<p>Rising up, like one awakening
uncertainly from sleep in a strange
room, he opened the ship's hatch
and looked out upon the land. A
flash of light caught his eyes then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
from above, and he looked up in
wonder.</p>

<p>He gasped.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class='cap'>ARIA, in the transparent cylinder,
sinking down through
the blue, like a leaf, settling gently
to the earth a hundred feet away.</div>

<p>She crawled out and stood looking
across the field of grass at him,
a strange, smile on her face.</p>

<p>Thorus leaped from his ship and
ran toward her. He ran silently.
She held out her hands and he
grasped them tenderly, as he would
grasp the hands of a child. And
all he could say was, "Aria. Aria."</p>

<p>"Thorus," she said, and there
was courage and joy in her voice.
"We've come back."</p>

<p>They stared into each other's
eyes for a long moment and then
they were close, and they held to
each other and swayed.</p>

<p>"Do you know what's happened?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Yes. You came back through
hyper-space while <i>I</i> came back
through the atoms." His voice was
quiet. "Oh, Lord. Oh good and
strange Lord. We forgot that one
of the great men twenty thousand
years ago, proved that space was
curved."</p>

<p>"Yes." She stood away from him
now, yet held to his hand. "We
couldn't escape from our place in
life or ourselves or the good and
the evil that we have done. We
came back to our earth and now
we must do what we have left undone."</p>

<p>There was much to be done.</p>

<p>Thorus looked around. He saw
in the distance a crushed and
smoking ruins. "I've destroyed the
Authority, but I've destroyed too
much. Now the people are in
chaos."</p>

<p>Aria stood silently awhile, and
then moved his arm. "But now you
can help me to heal them. You've
seen in the microcosm, as I have in
the macrocosm that all life is one.
Now we can show the people that
outer and inner space are not separate.
We can show them how they
exist together and how there can
be no escape in either or from
either. It will take a long time. But
we will do it. And the doing will
be grand." She paused. "The beginning
and the end, Thorus. The
greatness and the smallness. The
light and the darkness. It's all
here."</p>

<p>"And all that's in between. That
too."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered quietly.
"That too."</p>

<p>They turned to the smoking
ruins and arm in arm began walking toward it.</p>
